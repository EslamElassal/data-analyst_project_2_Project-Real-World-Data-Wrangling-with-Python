# Data Wrangling using Udacity Data Analyst 2

Completing this project is the second out of three required for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. It is intended to be an exercise in acquiring, evaluating, and cleaning data rather than a deep dive into the dataset.

I carefully considered my options and decided on datasets that include polling results and gun-related fatalities in every US county. I selected this pair of datasets since their time range overlaps and they may be combined by county.
